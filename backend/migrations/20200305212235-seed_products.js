<strong>OMEGA-6 (AA) TO OMEGA-3 (EPA) BALANCE</strong><br>Omega-6:3 Balance is measured as the ratio between the Omega-6 arachidonic acid (AA) and Omega-3 eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). A surplus of Omega-6 fatty acids reveals the diet is unbalanced. The ratio of Omega-6:3 in the body should&nbsp;preferably be below 3:1, and if the ratio is above 3:1 a change in your diet is beneficial. A low&nbsp;Omega-6:3 Balance is important for maintaining normal cell and tissue development.<br><br><strong>OMEGA-3 LEVEL (EPA+DHA)</strong><br>The Omega-3 level is the combined percentage value of the Omega-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA out of the total value of fatty acids found in the blood. Omega-3 has many benefits because they are the primary building blocks in your cells. EPA is dominant in blood, muscles and tissue, while DHA is dominant in brain, sperm and eyes. In the test report, the ideal range is 8% or more. European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) claims that EPA and DHA are contributing to the maintenance of normal heart function. DHA also contributes to the maintenance of normal vision and maintenance of normal brain function.<br><br><strong>CELL MEMBRANE FLUIDITY INDEX</strong><br>The ratio between saturated fatty acids and the marine Omega-3 essential fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is indicative of cell membrane fluidity. The more saturated the fats are in a membrane, the more rigid is the membrane. Conversely, the more polyunsaturated the fats are in a membrane, the more fluid is the membrane. Cell membrane composition and structural architecture is critical for the health of the cells and hence the body. On one hand, the membrane needs to be rigid enough to provide sound cellular structural architecture. On the other hand, the membrane needs to be fluid enough to allow nutrients in and waste products out. This index should be below 4:1.<br><br><strong>MENTAL STRENGTH - DIETARY INDEX</strong><br>This is the balance between Omega-6 (AA) and Omega-3 (EPA+DHA). A sufficient supply of marine Omega-3 fatty acids, DHA, in the diet contributes to the maintenance of a normal brain function. Daily administration of 3 g of marine omega-3’s EPA and DHA for 3 months significantly decreased feelings of anger and anxiety among users compared with the placebo group in a study. Several other clinical studies show that cognitive performance improves with increased anti-inflammatory consumption of marine omega-3 EPA and DHA. Childhood and old age are two critical and vulnerable stages and Omega-3 deficiency is associated with learning and memory deficits as well as mood. This Index should be below 1:1<br><br><strong>OMEGA-6 ARACHIDONIC ACID (AA) FORMATION EFFICIENCY</strong><br>This shows the efficiency by which your body converts Omega-6 (AA) fatty acids, from food in your diet into the essential fatty acids Omega-6 (AA) in your body. If you have less than 30% efficiency, you are recommended to include food in your diet that is high in AA, like chicken, turkey, pig and farmed salmon.`,

<strong>THE&nbsp;IMMUNE SYSTEM</strong><br>The immune system consists of the innate immune system and the adaptive immune system. Most of the time, the innate immune system is more important in<br>protecting us against infection. It consists of specialized cells and enzymes that are always present and ready to fight microbes at the site of infection as soon as the threat appears. The adaptive immune system can remember specific pathogens so it can provide long-lasting defense and protection against recurrent infections. Vitamin D is crucial to activating all our immune defenses, and without sufficient intake of the vitamin, the immune system is less able to fight off infections in the body.<br><br><strong>VITAMIN D3</strong><br>The vegan Vitamin D3 in Protect comes from organically grown lichen. Vitamin D3 is made in your skin when you get enough sunlight but also occurs in foods such as fatty fish, shrimps, egg and beef liver. In the northern part of the world, sun exposure is less, and therefore the skin does not produce enough Vitamin D3, which is why so many have low vitamin D levels.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>1,3/1,6 BETA-GLUCANS</strong><br>The 1,3/1,6 Beta-glucans in Protect is a specialized and standardized form of beta-glucans derived from a proprietary strain of baker’s yeast. The 1,3/1,6 Beta-glucans prime innate immune cells, allowing them to react more effectively. 1,3/1,6 Beta-glucans are naturally found in foods such as baker’s yeast, shiitake mushrooms, and some cereal grain but these have different structures and in studies are only half as effective. Yeast 1,3/1,6 Beta-glucans are different from the 1,3/1,4 Beta-glucans in oats (used in Zinobiotic and LeanShake), which have very different functions in the body.

Essential minerals such as calcium, phosphorus, sodium, magnesium, and zinc can be found making them one of the healthiest foods in the world. Dates have high levels of soluble fiber, which is essential in promoting healthy bowel movements and comfortable passage of food through the intestinal tract. Dates have natural occurring sugars like glucose, fructose, and sucrose. Therefore, they are the perfect snack for an immediate burst of energy. <br><br><strong>PUMPKIN SEEDS</strong> <br>Pumpkin seeds contain a wide variety of antioxidant phytonutrients, including some phenolic acids and polyphenols like the lignans. Pumpkin seeds also contain health-supportive phytosterols. Pumpkin seeds are a very good source of zinc, iron, phosphorus, magnesium, manganese and copper and the World Health Organization recommends their consumption as a good way of obtaining these nutrients. In addition, pumpkin seeds are a great source of dietary fiber, protein and the essential fatty acids Omega-3 and Omega-6. <br><br><strong>SESAME SEEDS</strong> <br>Sesame seeds have health benefits due to their nutritional content, including vitamins, minerals, natural oils, and organic compounds which consist of calcium, iron, magnesium, phosphorus, manganese, copper, zinc, fiber, thiamin, vitamin B6, folate, protein, and tryptophan.

<p><br><strong>THE EXTRACELLULAR MATRIX&nbsp;</strong><br>Human skin is composed of three major layers of tissue: the epidermis, dermis, and hypodermis. The extracellular matrix (ECM) is the fine mesh of microfibers is composed of compounds such as collagen, elastin and hyaluronic acid. The ECM is present throughout both epidermis and dermis and provides tensile strength and elasticity to the skin. The ingredients in our Skin Serum are targeted towards the ECM in both layers.<br><strong><br>PROTECTS, REPAIRS &amp; REBUILDS</strong><br>Sunlight ages skin by degrading the ECM. Our Skin Serum contains 4 active ingredients; squalane, 1-3, 1-6 beta-glucans, tocopherols &amp; tocotrienols, and olive polyphenols, which block this crucial part of the aging process at four different stages. For protection, Skin Serum contains 2 active ingredients; copper heptapeptide and 1-3, 1-6 beta-glucans, that enhances fibroblast activity in 2 complementary ways. Rebuilding the ECM hydrates and smooths the skin, increasing its elasticity and strength, reducing fine lines and the appearance of wrinkles. Rebuilding takes time, so to provide more rapid results, the serum adds two fast-acting compounds for instant benefits - calendula (an anti-inflammatory agent) and hyaluronic acid (a hydrating agent).<br><br><strong>INGREDIENTS</strong><br>Zinzino Skin Serum contains tracks of beta carotene, the natural color in many fruits, and vegetables. Repeated use of the serum creates a subtle golden glow - the same healthful and attractive bloom associated with a healthy diet. We also include other essential ingredients in the Skin Serum like Shea Butter and sunflower oil, both with good moisturizing properties and Chondrus, a seaweed that has both a moisturizing and a UV protecting effect. Sepiolite, a mineral clay, is added for its antiseptic and skin healing property, whereas Avena Sativa and oat extract helps in giving relief to irritated skin. Finally, we added Betaine to support the water balance in the cells and also have anti-inflammatory properties.<br><br><strong>FRAGRANCE &amp; PARABEN FREE, NO ANIMAL TESTING&nbsp;</strong><br>Our Skin Serum contains no added fragrances. Its faint neutral odor comes from its natural active ingredients, such as the beta-glucans. In addition, the Skin Serum is paraben-free and not tested on animals.</p>`,

The good bacteria contribute to many important body functions, such as educating our immune system.
